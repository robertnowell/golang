Chapter eleven is a kind of test drive of golang's testing tools.

Palindrome contains a program for checking whether a string is a palindrome as well as a set of testing tools that generate random palindromes and non-palindromes in order to rigorously test the IsPalindrome function.

Assert contains split_test.go which tests the strings.Split function.

Echo contains a function that mimics the unix echo command, and a set of tests for this implementation.  

Storage contains a sample function for notifying a storage system's users if their current database usage is more than 90% of their storage quota.
